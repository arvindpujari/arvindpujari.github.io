I'm currently in the first year of the MRes+PhD programme in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology at the NanoDTC, in the University of Cambridge. I work on light-rechargeable lithium ion photobatteries and am a member of St Edmunds's College, where I am also the Secretary of the CR (student body).

Before this, I completed my undergraduate degree in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT M). There, I was awarded the Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma Gold Medal as the undergraduate student with the best all-round performance in curricular and extracurricular activities between 2016-2020. My undergraduate research mainly focussed on aluminium based plasmonics and received the B. Krishnamurthy Award for the best undergraduate thesis at IIT Madras as well as the INAE Innovative Student Project Award for being amongst the eight best undergraduate capstone projects in India. I also had the opportunity to undertake research internships at Purdue University in the USA and, IIT Gandhinagar. I was also the head of Team Sahaay, the social innovation club of IIT Madras, based at the Centre of Innovation (CFI). There, I lead projects on toilet seat sanitation (which received the prestigious Gandhian Young Technological Innovation Award) and automatic waste segregation (which was a Singapore Regional Finalist of the Hult Prize and a winner of a silver medal at the 7th Inter IIT Tech Meet). I was also the first sophomore to head a team at IIT Madras when I lead the Editiorial and Research Team at the Entrepreneurship Cell (E-Cell) of IIT Madras where we produced India's first student run entrepreneurship magazine: Entrepreneurship Insider.
